# Docker
# The Dockerfile itself should generally be committed,
# but temporary Docker-related files should not.
.dockerignore   # This file itself should typically be committed
!.dockerignore  # (Uncomment the line above if you want to explicitly include .dockerignore)
# .dockerignore should be committed, but this is a common pattern to include it if it was accidentally excluded.
# So, usually you just need '!.dockerignore' if you are trying to ensure it's not ignored by a broader rule like *.
